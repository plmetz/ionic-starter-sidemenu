# Customizing Project

If you plan on using this project as a starter template there are several steps you should take in order to setup the project to work with your own tools and accounts. For instance you'd need to point tools such as the [README](../README.md) badges to your own repository. You'd also want to customize Ionic files for your own project.

To complete the customization you should follow the directions in the following documents:

1) [Ionic Customization](customizing_ionic.md) - provides instructions on customizing the Ionic project
2) [Tooling Customization](customizing_tooling.md) - provides instructions on customizing the tooling used in this starter project
