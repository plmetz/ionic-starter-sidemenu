# Customizing Project

If you plan on using this project as a starter template there are several steps you should take in order to setup the project to work with your own tools and accounts. For instance you'd need to point tools such as the [README](../README.md) badges to your own repository.

Each tool listed has:
- A brief explanation of what it is used for in this project
- Instructions on customizing it for your own use
- Instructions on removing if not needed

**Note:** Before customizing you should follow the directions in the [README](../README.md) to clone the repository and then you will need to push it up to your own git repository (github is used for these examples).
