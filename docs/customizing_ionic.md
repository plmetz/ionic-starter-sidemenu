# Customizing Ionic

Upon starting a new Ionic project there are several places in the codebase that you will want to customize to your particular project. They are listed below to help you find all the items:

* [ionic.config.json](../ionic.config.json):
  * `name`
* [package.json](../package.json):
  * `name`
  * `version`
  * `author`
  * `homepage`
  * `description`
* [README](../README.md) - you will want to configure this to suit your project
