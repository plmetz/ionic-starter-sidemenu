# Personalized Ionic Stater - Side Menu

This is an opinionated and personalized starter for [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) based off the side menu starter.

## Purpose

As a serial project starter and tinkerer I use `ionic start` quite often. As great as the Ionic Starters are I found myself often making the same changes each time I started a project. Therefore this is the culmination basic changes that I make every time I run `ionic start`.

## Scope

I don't expect many other people to have the same coding preferences as me therefore I don't expect this project to be useful to very many people. Nevertheless feel free to use it as you please if it fits your needs.

## Deviations Made From Ionic Starter

#### TSLint and Editor Config:

Changes to support my coding style and preferences in `tslint.json` and `.editorconfig` and then linted and updated rest of code base to comply with those changes.

## Using

* [Download the installer](https://nodejs.org/) for Node.js LTS (8.x.x).
* Install the ionic CLI globally: `npm install -g ionic`
  * *Note: Use `sudo` on linux/ubuntu*
* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/plmetz/ionic-starter-sidemenu.git`.
* Run `npm install` from the project root.
* Run `ionic serve` in a terminal from the project root.
* If you plan on using this as a starter for your own project see [customizing doc](docs/customizing_main.md) for more information.

*For additional usage documentation and information check out the great [Ionic Docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/).*

## Contributing

I am always up for a spirited discussion on coding styles and preferences. If you see something that either doesn't comply with my stated styles or you believe one of my style choices could be improved please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/plmetz/ionic-starter-sidemenu/issues/new) or create a PR. I am always open to suggestions on how to improve the readability, useability, performance, or functionality of my code.

**NOTE:** Style and coding preferences are just that ... preferences. This is not the place that we will finally settle tabs vs spaces or indent size. While I am very open to suggestions to improve my code as stated above this is an opinionated project and thus some choices are just my preferences.
